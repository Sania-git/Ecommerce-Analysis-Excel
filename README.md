# Ecommerce-Analysis-Excel
I built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze an e-commerce dataset, transforming raw transaction data into actionable insights. The project focused on tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), uncovering sales and customer behavior patterns, and applying customer segmentation techniques to support data-driven decision-making and identify growth opportunities.

## Dataset
The Dataset of this project was sourced from Kaggle. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/refiaozturk/e-commerce-sales]

## Overview
This project involved analyzing an e-commerce dataset to evaluate sales performance and customer behavior. Using Excel, I cleaned and structured raw transaction data, applied techniques such as RFM segmentation, forecasting, and Pareto analysis, and developed a dynamic dashboard for visualization. The dashboard highlights key metrics like revenue trends, average order value, customer retention, and churn. By combining interactive charts, slicers, and KPIs, the project delivers a comprehensive view of business performance and provides actionable insights to guide strategic decision-making.

## Tools & Techniques Used
**TOOL : Microsoft Excel** – for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization<br>
**TECHNIQUES:** 
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts – to summarize and explore sales and customer data
- Formulas & Functions – including IF, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, etc., for data calculations
- RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) – for customer segmentation
- Pareto (80/20) Analysis – to identify high-value products/customers
- Forecasting Tools – to predict future sales trends
- Dashboard Design – building a clean, insight-driven, and interactive interface for decision-making

- **Products**: Laptops and Smartphones drive ~85–90% of total revenue.
- **Regions**: East has fewer customers but highest revenue per customer.
- **Spending**: Medium spenders generate ~50% of revenue; VIP spenders key for growth.
- **Seasonality**: Q4 revenue spikes; retention needed post-promotions.

## Recommendations
- Retention: Loyalty programs for Potential Loyalists; reactivation campaigns for At Risk customers.
- Product Strategy: Prioritize Laptops and Smartphones; bundle low-performing products.
- Regional Strategy: Invest in East (high-value customers); expand in South and West.
- Data Roadmap: Incorporate CLV, cohort analysis, and profitability metrics for deeper insights.

## Next Steps
- Launch targeted campaigns for top and at-risk customers.
- Perform SKU-level profitability analysis.
- Build predictive CLV models for marketing strategies.
- Automate dashboards to monitor KPIs monthly.
