# Ecommerce-Analysis-Excel
I built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze an e-commerce dataset, transforming raw transaction data into actionable insights. The project focused on tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), uncovering sales and customer behavior patterns, and applying customer segmentation techniques to support data-driven decision-making and identify growth opportunities.

## Dataset
The Dataset of this project was sourced from Kaggle. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/refiaozturk/e-commerce-sales]

## Overview
This project involved analyzing an e-commerce dataset to evaluate sales performance and customer behavior. Using Excel, I cleaned and structured raw transaction data, applied techniques such as RFM segmentation, forecasting, and Pareto analysis, and developed a dynamic dashboard for visualization. The dashboard highlights key metrics like revenue trends, average order value, customer retention, and churn. By combining interactive charts, slicers, and KPIs, the project delivers a comprehensive view of business performance and provides actionable insights to guide strategic decision-making.
